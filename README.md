# Automated Fire Detection and Safety Alert System using IOT

## Overview

The **Automated Fire Detection and Safety Alert System** is an Arduino-based embedded system designed to detect the presence of fire using a flame sensor. The system continuously monitors the environment and immediately activates visual and audible alarms whenever a flame is detected.

When the flame sensor detects fire, the Arduino turns on an LED indicator and plays an alarm melody through a buzzer to alert nearby people. If no flame is detected, the LED remains OFF, the buzzer is silent, and the system continues monitoring.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of sensor interfacing, digital input processing, and real-time fire detection using Arduino.

# Working Principle

1. Arduino initializes all input and output pins.
2. The flame sensor continuously monitors the surrounding area.
3. Arduino reads the digital output from the flame sensor.
4. If a flame is detected:
   - LED turns ON.
   - Buzzer plays an alarm melody.
   - "FLAME, FLAME, FLAME" is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
5. If no flame is detected:
   - LED remains OFF.
   - Buzzer stops.
   - "no flame" is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
6. The monitoring process repeats continuously.
